# phorgePDF
Adobe pdf software sucks. All I want to do is view a pdf, add some text to it, and add signatures - all while using a non-clunky and choppy app. This is why I built phorgePDF - a lightweight pdf editor thatâ€™s fast and can let you do the following:

- Viewing a pdf (revolutionary, I know)
- Signing a document
- Reordering or deleting a few pages
- Highlighting text
- Adding text
